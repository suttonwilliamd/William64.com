# Understanding Sitemap Functionality

Sitemaps are an essential component of modern websites, serving as a roadmap for both search engines and visitors to understand the structure and content of your site.

## What is a Sitemap?

A sitemap is an XML file that lists all the important pages of your website, making it easier for search engines like Google to discover and index your content. It's like a table of contents for your website.

## Why Sitemaps Matter

1. **SEO Benefits**: Search engines can more efficiently crawl and index your site
2. **Content Discovery**: Ensures all your pages are found, even those not well-linked
3. **Site Organization**: Helps you understand and maintain your site structure
4. **User Experience**: Some sitemaps are also available in HTML format for human visitors

## How Astro Handles Sitemaps

The Astro framework has built-in sitemap support through the `@astrojs/sitemap` integration. When properly configured, it automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file during the build process.

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://william64.com",
  integrations: [sitemap()],
});
```

## Key Sitemap Elements

- `<url>`: Contains information about a single URL
- `<loc>`: The location (URL) of the page
- `<lastmod>`: When the page was last modified
- `<changefreq>`: How frequently the page is likely to change
- `<priority>`: The priority of this URL relative to other URLs

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Updated**: Your sitemap should reflect your current site structure
2. **Include Important Pages**: Focus on pages you want search engines to index
3. **Exclude Duplicates**: Avoid listing duplicate or low-value pages
4. **Submit to Search Engines**: Use Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools

## Testing Your Sitemap

You can test your sitemap by:

1. Building your Astro site: `npm run build`
2. Checking the generated `sitemap.xml` file
3. Validating it using online sitemap validators
4. Submitting it to search engines

By implementing a proper sitemap, you're taking an important step toward better SEO and a more discoverable website.
