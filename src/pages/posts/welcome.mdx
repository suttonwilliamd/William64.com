# Welcome to William64.com

This is my digital playground, built with a combination of modern tech and retro aesthetics. I'm a software engineer with a passion for low-level systems, vintage computers, and the art of clean code.

## Why the Terminal Theme?

I've always been drawn to the minimalist elegance of command-line interfaces. There's something pure about the green text on a black background â€“ it strips away distractions and focuses on what matters: the content and the code.

```js
// The essence of what I love
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello from the terminal!");
  return {
    aesthetic: "minimal",
    focus: "content",
    distractions: null
  };
}
